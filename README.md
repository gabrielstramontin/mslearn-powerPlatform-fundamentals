# Microsoft Power Platform Fundamentals
This repository contains labs instructions and demo scripts for hands-on exercises in the Microsoft Official Courseware to support the [ Microsoft Power Platform Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/exams/pl-900) certification. The demos exercises are designed by MCTs to complement the associated training modules on [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/training), and a <u>subset</u> of these exercises comprises the hands-on labs in the official [PL-900: Microsoft Power Platform Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/on-demand-instructor-led-training-series/?terms=PL-900&products=power-platform) instructor-led training course.

## Contributing to this repo
Microsoft Certified Trainers (MCTs) are welcome to submit issues and PRs related to content or assets in this repo, subject to the guidance in the [GitHub User Guide for MCTs](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/MCT-User-Guide/). Trainers should bear in mind that the repo is designed to support self-paced learners on Microsoft Learn as well as students in instructor-led courses, and that some of the exercises in the repo are not included in the hosted lab profiles for classroom delivery.

## Notes:

### Classroom Materials
It is strongly recommended that MCTs and Partners access these materials and in turn, provide them separately to students.  Pointing students directly to GitHub to access Lab steps as part of an ongoing class will require them to access yet another UI as part of the course, contributing to a confusing experience for the student. An explanation to the student regarding why they are receiving separate Lab instructions can highlight the nature of an always-changing cloud-based interface and platform. Microsoft Learning support for accessing files on GitHub and support for navigation of the GitHub site is limited to MCTs teaching this course only.
